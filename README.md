It's 2024 october 9, and I had a crazy thought I should write a little console game in Assembly for a 8086 processor. 
I have a computer architecture class and today's class gave me inspiration.

The objective will be to avoid obstacles that are coming your way

I want to add sound and color to this!

TODO list:
- player has to stay in play_area
- player has to die upon collision with obstacle
- obstacles should move a char per sec
- maybe a timer/score
